<p>This is gonna be a long post and perhaps the longest post I will ever attempt to write but I have a lot of things pent up in so I really want to get them out and talk about what makes a video game good or bad. I know I cannot force anyone to read it and I know that a lot of you will initially not bother to read because it’s not an anime or a video game most of you played. The second issue is the sheer size of the entire post which could be summarized by more talented individuals but I cannot simply express myself like that. So I ask those who wish to skim through it at least bear with me and go through till the end. I am also glad that I was able to purchase the game legally on the Nintendo switch whereas I previously pirated it so I guess there is a sense of pride I have.</p>
<p>Bioshock Infinite was the final installment of perhaps one of the most popular of the last decade. It follows the story of Booker Dewitt a ‘handyman’ who has debts to clear so in order to do that he is hired by two mysterious figures known as the Lutteces who take him to a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean where upon entry he is taken to a utopia in the clouds. Booker’s objective was simply to get a hold of a girl who was very special however she is locked up behind the secrets of the city but more importantly the leader of the city who claims to be a prophet who can see the future. What ensues is blood, deception and truth.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>Lets talk about the fairly simple thing first. The gameplay although reminiscent of the first two bioshock games where you can get plasmids (vigor in this game) of different sorts which have a varying degree of effects alongside your usual firearms. The vigors remain largely the same as the games before with an added twist which made its usage much more fun. Previously you could use plasmids to have a singular purpose whether it be to electrocute, put to flame or telepathy however in this game each vigor has an additional ability in which if you hold on to the vigor action button you are given the ability to get a slightly more advanced effect. To put it simply all three games have the electric bolt plasmid/vigor but with infinites new addition holding onto the vigor button allowed you to set up electrical traps on the ground which were very fun to play with. The environment in Bioshock infinite was much more open compared to the congested levels in rapture from the previous games so setting up these traps on the open area and watching the enemies fall for the traps were satisfying to say the least. However as interesting as the vigors were as I played through the game twice once being on normal and the other on the 1999 mode I realized I kept using the same 3 vigors over and over again because the other vigors just felt irrelevant. I mean when you are being ganged up by enemies literally all over you barely have time to set up the traps and most of the time you just end up running out of vigor which is a huge problem because unlike the first game you don’t get a limited refills of plasmid gel you can carry around. You have to consume food or loot the dead or buy vigor from the shop to refill. This was extremely annoying in fights because you had to be stingy with your vigor and it takes away the fun of the experimentation you look forward to.</p>
<p>Moving on from vigors let’s talk about perhaps my most favorite part of the gameplay and this is gonna sound very controversial and downright insulting but here we go. I loved that you could only use 2 weapons at a given time. BEFORE I AM CRUCIFIED HEAR ME OUT. I recently finished bioshock 1 and 2 and I realized with 8-9 weapons at our disposal at all times we tend to think we are pretty unstoppable but we really aren’t. Some of the weapons are outright terrible and this was a big case in bioshock 2 that I only relied on the machine gun and the rivet gun. This is because both of the guns had 3 different kinds of ammos so that alone made two weapons into 6 weapons and I had like 5 other weapons with 3 modes each as well. This can make you very confused when it comes to trying to find out which weapon deals the best damage to who. While you could use the recorder to fight and figure out it was simply easier to just machine gun every enemy in the game to death which made the other weapons pretty much useless. I feel infinite did a good job somewhat to the two weapon system because situation wise the game allows you to find the items you need most of the time but you could actually finish the game with your trusty shotgun and carbine alongside a bit of sniper rifle fun. This also allowed me to focus on the upgrades of the weapons I REALLY wanted instead of the random weapon upgrade system in the previous bioshock game where it just upgraded one weapon and it was done. Even though I love this I still have my fair share of criticism towards it. In the previous games the weapons you had were yours and each time you upgraded it the weapon had a clear indication that it was upgraded. There were extra parts attached and it looked really cool every time you pulled it out because it was also a sort of achievement. The weapon upgrades in this game is meh because it features a FPS style pick up your enemies weapon and just go on rubbish. This was really disappointing as I wanted to have weapons I called my own but I actually had to switch out weapons quite a few times due to very tight corners of the game where ammo was a big deal. This resulted me in often using poorly designed weapons with horrid mechanics and no upgrades which lead to significantly more deaths and honestly that was such a letdown.</p>
<p>Finally let’s talk about the thing that disappointed me the most. Bioshock 1 and 2 were pretty fun to play shooters and in a pretty cool environment. Rapture was this dark downtrodden place and the enemies were insane people with nothing to lose. You went in a room with barely any cover so you had to be quick with your weapons as well as your plasmids to engage the foes and move onto the next one. The battles weren’t delayed and they also weren’t easy, it was action packed and intense so we focused on the actual job of killing our foes. Infinite however decided to throw that beautiful piece of foundation out the window and went with the stupid fps route. By all means I do not hate fps, call of duty 4 and halo were pretty much my childhood but there is something inherently wrong with making a game like bioshock into your standard fps. We went from shooting up baddies in a room to HIDING BEHIND COVER AND TWO SHOTTING EVERY ENEMY. What were they thinking I have no idea but this part was such a shit show and I honestly could not have been more heartbroken as I was playing in the hardest difficulty in the whole bioshock franchise and I realized as long as I was behind cover I was safe from enemy fire. 1999 mode on bioshock infinite is a nightmare and playing it on the switch was insanely hard (yea yea I am a retard for playing on the switch, heard it a million times idc). The number of times I died early on in the normal or 1999 mode far outclassed the number of times I died in bioshock 2 hard mode. I realized this was because I had an expectation of Bioshock games to be a shooter and not some be a pussy and hide behind cover fps. This very expectation led me to fail spectacularly and die over and over again. As hard as the game is the game only gets harder because of your expectations. The first two games had amazing sub bosses such as the big daddies, big sisters and grunts was replaced by motorized patriots, handymen and various armored brutes with powerful guns. This felt downright insulting because fighting big daddies in the first two games felt something of a rush. They were big intimidating and you knew you were in for a fight but handymen were just there. You had no preparation and suddenly in the middle of a fight this big ugly dude in a weird ass iron man suit comes and throws you around like a ragdoll as you confusedly wonder how to deal with it alongside the MILLION other enemies shooting at you. If you consider that challenging you are wrong, that’s stupid my guy. This also kind of applies to the enemies in infinite because they just feel like enemies you have to kill. There doesn’t seem to be an impending sense of threat that you felt from the splicers in the first game. The first game had such amazing grunts because they fit into their environment so well. They were drug hopped fiends who were insane and killing them was a necessity but more importantly it also felt like a kindness. Infinite also disrespects that by making the enemies just another target to shoot your way through. There isn’t a sense of doom or a feel of regret as you mow down enemy after enemy. I could go on and on but what is the point? Bioshock infinite failed to provide the same gameplay which drew me into the first two games. The only bright side was probably that using the skyhooks was kinda cool. Just grab on to a rail and wooosh around. Was fun but still shiet. Rating 4/10.</p>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>If you thought the last part was big buckle down and have a seat. Spoilers but the story of infinite is horrendous. To demonstrate I want to go into detail about what made the first two games so spectacular and I will leave a link to a video from which I took reference from (BECAUSE PLAGIARISM IS BAD KIDS, STOP DOING THAT), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b81nGs7J3y0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b81nGs7J3y0</a>.
Bioshock 1 and 2 both take place in rapture with different philosophies dictating the story. Bioshock 1 was about the philosophy of its ever colorful leader Andrew Ryan. Ryan was a very interesting character because he was influential and powerful in the surface world but he realized that the surface world was plagued with the disease of society. The wars, greed and suffering left him in a state of negativity towards the surface so with his massive wealth and influence he created a city in the depths of the ocean where he bought with him a set of talented individuals to create a utopia. Ryan was a believer of the self where he values the individuality of people which sets them apart. This is made apparently clear from the people he invited into rapture. Actors, singers, scientists and artists. Ryan believed that society can truly become one together if it consisted of unique individuals who had the capability to think for themselves and not be dependent on the collective conscience of society which often held them back. This strikes so well with the villains in the first game, for example let’s see Cohen the mad artist. Cohen as an artist in rapture does not fear the consequences of his action to find what real art is. He has killed and tortured people to find his magnum opus and this is evident especially when he throws his own disciples at us to see our ‘art’. Eventually this individuality based society would be what lead to the downfall of the rapture society. This actually plays very will the theory of the self because when you let individuals run amok they tend to do things their way. The different factions that made up Ryan’s rapture eventually lead to its downfall. This story was unraveled so slowly and meticulously with the discovery of ADAM. ADAM was discovered by Frank Fontaine who was a mere smuggler in rapture and with ADAM he has given the world of rapture something to marvel about. The people of rapture missed the sun and with ADAM they had a sort of release as not only did it give them powers it gave them an addiction and a reliance towards it. The people stopped depending on themselves and started depending on this gift by another individual who started essentially uniting the people. This was the prime reason the entirety of rapture collapsed because after ADAM was discovered Ryan lost control. The people were no longer individuals but were confused dependent masses who were fighting for the need to desire something superficial. A false sense of relief and power which lead to the events of the first game. On paper Andrew Ryan’s utopia of individuals’ sounds like heaven but in reality we all are slaves to something and that could not have been made more painfully clear in the first game. It was a sad tale of how brilliant minds were ruined and manipulated by the human greed. I still remember the chill I got at the end of Ryans life when he directed you the player to kill him with the phrase ‘would you kindly’ and this is still regarded as one of gaming’s biggest plot twists.</p>
<p>Bioshoc 2 on the other hand did a complete 180 and focused on the teachings of Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarianism. In the second installment of the game which takes place 10 years after the first game we see the sorry state of the once great rapture. All of the individuals have become crazed addicts of ADAM, the city is in ruins and desperate for leadership the city has come under the control of the psychologist Sofia Lamb. Now Lamb as a character was quite flat but her ideologies was what made the second game interesting. After the fall of rapture, Ryan and Atlas she rose up to lead the broken people. She flocked the people with the promise of Adam and managed to completely unite a world of mindless goons into obedient servants with the ideology of utilitarianism. The way she used this was through the exploitation of little sisters who were little girls infused with sea slugs who could Mass produce ADAM for the population of rapture. She gave the people something to rely on and it was through the horrific experiments forced on the little girls. Not only had that she decided to make her own daughter the embodiment of rapture. We play as subject delta a big daddy one of the most interesting aspects from the first game. We are taught the purpose of the big daddies and how they are made to protect the little sisters from harm and we realize the true sickness that has taken over rapture. It wasn’t the ADAM or the experimentations or the wars that took place in it. It’s the fact that those who rule rapture have made themselves to be more than human. Look at Atlas and Ryan in the first game who believed they had ultimate power and they could justify their actions however possible. There was religious fanaticism as well as political manipulation which made it an excellent real life example. I don’t wanna get too much into the game because I already made a review on this game here. My point for making a reminder of these two games was to show exactly how Bioshock infinite was lacking.</p>
<p>Bioshock infinite takes place in the sky as opposed to the depths of the sea and it is called Columbia. Booker dewitt is the first of the protagonist to start talking which is not all bad but what’s bad is how he isn’t fazed by anything at all. From the moment he enters the Columbia in the sky he just kind of accepts it and starts murdering people. This bothered me because as a protagonist booker definitely had more interesting aspects compared to his silent counterparts subject delta and Jack but he was unchanging overall. He had a singular mindset in trying to find Elizabeth a girl trapped in Columbia. You know what I don’t even wanna get in to the story because face it there is no real depth to this game. The game is a basic shooter and the enemies are just target practice. For a game called Bioshock infinite the choices you make have NO effect whatsoever towards the ending of the game. This was particularly heartbreaking for me because the first two games had this morality based endings where our choices lead to what we ended up seeing at the end. We had a choice to save the little sisters or harvest them and we had a choice to spare our enemies as well as kill them. This had a big impacts on our endings and that was very fun to explore. Infinite had a dumb plot. Apparently you the player sold your daughter to remove your debt but you ended up not wanting to do it and you sold your daughter to another version of you who became a religious fanatic who went on to make Columbia and time travel dimensions and shit happened. Don’t get into it. Elizabeth is basically god who can access infinite worlds and guess what you don’t even beat the villain Comstock in the main world you end up beating him in the THIRD world you gain access to.
Ok so the point is Bioshock infinite is a stupid game. Its gameplay is a disappointing downwards spiral and its story is a mess. This was supposed to be my loveletter to a franchise I love so much but the more I wanted to write the more disheartened I was by the number of things the game got wrong. The dlc of the games were actually a ray of hope as they managed to at least make it a somewhat of a sad hopeful link to the first game. Bioshock infinite wasn’t a bioshock game at all. It did not have the aspects of the first two games and I think the worst crime was perhaps the fact that the game constantly reminded us that it was a bioshock game. It kept trying to make these tie ins to the first two games with the stupid line of ‘there is always a lighthouse, there is always a man and there is always a city’. When you keep making reminders that you are something you are not you know you failed. Bioshock infinite was a failure no matter how you look at it. Overall rating 3/10 don’t play this game if you love the bioshock series.</p>
